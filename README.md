# Piano Tiles VGA Verilog Game for FPGA DE-1 SOC Board
## Description
Completed as part of the CSC258 final project. Full code complete with RAM modules for 3 songs: Mary had a Little Lamb, Fur Elise, and Unravel (from Tokyo Ghoul). Game can be played on a DE-1 SOC board with a VGA monitor and PS2 keyboard.

Implemented via a discrete datapath and control module with songs manually coded as mif files initialized into RAM modules. Each column also exists as a discrete module.

## Controls
Keys: A S D F correspond to each column in the tiles game. Score displayed on the hexadecimal display on the DE-1 board.

## Credits
Credits to Shirley Wang, who was my project partner for the duration of the course.
